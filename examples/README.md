# Examples

this directory contains two examples on how to extract data.

## Example 1: time_series_extraction

In this example time series for climatology for the variable "plant available water" for a specific layer, for a location in JÃ¼lich and saved as CSV.

The data used for this example can be found under: https://service.tereno.net/thredds/dodsC/forecastnrw/products/climatology_v2/paw_DE05_ECMWF-HRES_hindcast_r1i1p2_FZJ-IBG3-ParFlowCLM380_hgfadapter-h00-v02bJurecaGpuProdClimatologyTl_1hr2daily_20230101-20231231.nc


## Example 2: variable_extraction

In this example the daily subsurface storage will be extracted for the 15 available layers for a location in Lille, Belgium, and then the monthly total subsurface storage is calculated and plotted.
